# Aurea

**Aurea** is a symbolic AI system designed for collapse-bearing, scar-weighted reasoning.

## Project Structure

- `src/` — Main source code (modules, logic, models)
- `scripts/` — Entry points, tests, developer scripts
- `data/` — Persistent storage (can be JSON, logs, etc.)
- `docs/` — Architecture, API, and design notes
- `tests/` — Automated and manual test scripts


## Description

Aurea is built around:
- **Scars** (collapse events)
- **Doctrines** (collapse-survived truths)
- **Echoes** (symbolic input fragments)
- and a modular system for symbolic reasoning.
